		<string>10 stabbed, beaten at white nationalist rally in California</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Ten people suffered stab wounds and other injuries on Sunday after members of a white nationalist group that planned to rally outside the California state Capitol building in Sacramento clashed with a larger group of counter protesters, authorities said.

The fight broke out when about 30 members of the Traditionalist Worker Party gathering to rally around noon Sunday were met by about 400 counter-protesters, California Highway Patrol Officer George Granada said.

As people tried to leave the area, smaller fights broke out, Granada said.

Of the injured, two were taken to the hospital with critical stab wounds, but they were expected to survive, officials said.

Police were investigating two assaults that happened outside the Capitol grounds, but no arrests have been made, the Sacramento Police Department said in a statement.

The Capitol was on lockdown until protesters cleared the area.

Videos from the melee posted on social media showed mounted police officers dispersing a group of mostly young people, some with their faces covered, while some throw stones toward a man holding a stick and being shielded by police officers in riot gear.

A KCRA-TV reporter and his cameraman were caught in an altercation with protesters who shouted &quot;no cameras&quot; as they tried to grab their equipment and shove them away from the crowd.

Sacramento Fire Department spokesman Chris Harvey said nine men and one woman, ranging from 19 to 58 years old, were treated for stab wounds, cuts, scrapes and bruises.

&quot;There was a large number of people carrying sticks and rushing to either get into the melee or see what was going on,&quot; Harvey said.

The victims were all present while the protest took place, said Sacramento Police spokesman Matt McPhail but he said it was still unclear whether and how they were involved.

The Traditionalist Workers Party had scheduled and received a permit to protest for two hours in front of the Capitol. Law enforcement was aware of the counter-protest effort and police deployed more than 100 officers to the Capitol, McPhail said.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has described TWP as a group formed in 2015 as the political wing of the Traditionalist Youth Network, which aims to &quot;indoctrinate high school and college students into white nationalism.&quot;

Matthew Heimbach, chairman of the Traditionalist Worker Party, told the Los Angeles Times that his group and the Golden State Skinheads organized the Sunday rally. Heimbach said that in the clash, one of their marchers had been stabbed in an artery and six of the counter-protesters had also been stabbed.

Vice chairman Matt Parrott, who was not present at the Sacramento rally, blamed &quot;leftist radicals&quot; for instigating the violence.

A message left at a phone number for the Traditionalist Worker Party was not immediately returned to The Associated Press.

A post recently uploaded to site of the Traditionalist Youth Network said TWP members planned to march in Sacramento to protest against globalization and in defense of their right to free expression. They said they expected to be outnumbered 10-to-1 by counter-protesters.

&quot;We concluded that it was time to use this rally to make a statement about the precarious situation our race is in,&quot; the Traditionalist Youth Network statement said. &quot;With our folk on the brink of becoming a disarmed, disengaged, and disenfranchised minority, the time to do something was yesterday!&quot;

The clash Sunday follows a confrontation in March between Ku Klux Klan members and counter-protesters in Anaheim, California in which three people were stabbed.</string>

		<string>This country&apos;s not even in Europe, but may get walloped by Brexit anyhow</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>Tokyo, we have a problem.

Last week, market tumult stemming from the U.K.&apos;s vote to quit the European Union drove the British pound to its weakest levels in three decades.

Yet it also sent investors flocking to traditional safe haven assets like the U.S. dollar, gold and the yen, the latter surging against every major currency as the results of Brexit became clear: Dollar/yen (: OSEJPY=)spiked from a Thursday high near 107 to a two-year low near 99. Meanwhile, the pound lost more than 8 percent against the yen (Exchange: JPYGBP=) and the euro (Exchange: EURJPY=) shed more than four percent to hit a three-and-a-half-year low.

The currency&apos;s strength was enough to prompt the Japanese government to hold an emergency meeting on Monday, Reuters reported, in order to craft a strategy to counteract yen strength. In currency market parlance, that suggests the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could intervene at any time to sell the very yen traders are trying to buy—something the central bank already does on a frequent basis.

Japan needs a weaker yen to boost the economy, but at least for the moment investors need a safe haven even more. So which impulse will win the tug of war?

&quot;Classic risk aversion is in full manifestation,&quot; said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager in the global multi-asset group at OppenheimerFunds. &quot;It&apos;s a defensive currency in an environment where global growth is slowing.&quot;

De Longis pointed out that the yen was already on a strengthening trend even before Brexit, with fears about the global economy festering.

The fallout means the currency is rapidly becoming a proxy for investors&apos; need for a shelter in a storm of continued uncertainty—and that complicates Japan&apos;s efforts to engineer a sustainable economic recovery.

A weak yen is a linchpin of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s policies—better known as &quot;Abenomics&quot; — to revive the world&apos;s third-largest economy, which is also one of the globe&apos;s largest exporters. Although Japan has muddled through decades of sluggish growth, its lack of external debt and a still wealthy society makes it an attractive haven for investors scampering from global risk aversion.

&quot;The [looming] exit of the U.K. from the European Union has intensified the safety attraction of Japan and the Japanese yen,&quot; said Joseph Trevisani, a chief currency strategist at Worldwide markets.

&quot;Japan is hardly a robust economy but it is an island and not about to collapse,&quot; he added.

&quot;Despite the failure of Abenomics to promote growth traders prefer the stability of Japan to the widening circle of questionable economies around the globe.&quot;

However, the yen&apos;s is now operating as a proxy for global risk aversion, raising risks for Japan&apos;s trade balance. In April, the country posted a deficit, but exports grew 8 percent year on year.

A strengthening currency imperils that export growth, and heightens the risk that the BoJ—one of the most assertive central banks in the world in terms of managing currency risk—could sell yen to counteract the upward pressure.

Brexit by itself &quot;doesn&apos;t have black swan characteristics. It isn&apos;t like something appearing out of nowhere with big scale size and power,&quot; said Richard Hastings, a macro specialist at Seaport Global Securities, speaking about a destabilizing event like the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers—the tinder that sparked a worldwide financial panic.

Nonetheless, &quot;the problem for assets is that it encourages the BoJ to…make sure that these currencies don&apos;t strengthen too much,&quot; Hastings said. &quot;Part of the mechanism is to crush the yields on their government bonds, and that pulls down yields on U.S Treasury yields,&quot; which are already at historically low levels, he said.

That said, &quot;there might be a limit to what the BoJ can do to prevent yen from rallying,&quot; he added—especially as the veneer of European unity splinters.

In fact, markets may already be fanning the embers of the next crisis. While all worldwide bourses tumbled on Friday, OppenheimerFunds&apos; de Longis pointed out that certain European markets fared worse—which could be an ominous sign.

Friday&apos;s &quot;price action tells you everything you need to know: who are the worst performing markets? Spain and Italy,&quot; he said, noting the bourses of both countries reeled by double digits—even worse than London&apos;s exchanges.

Those flashpoints &quot;are treated as the worst performers, and indicative of where the next risks lie,&quot; de Longis added.</string>

		<string>11-Year-Old Boy Attacked by Shark in North Carolina While Surfing, Two Weeks After Teen Bitten in Same Location</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>An 11-year-old boy was attacked by a shark in North Carolina Saturday afternoon. 
According to WCTI, the victim was surfing off Atlantic Beach when he was attacked. 
Atlantic Beach Fire Chief Adam Snyder said first responders were called at 2:34 p.m. for a reported shark bite and the boy was transported to a local hospital with &quot;deep wounds&quot; on his left foot. The size and kind of shark is unknown. The beach remained open after the attack. Atlantic Beach is no stranger to shark encounters. Two weeks ago, an 18-year-old man was bitten on his hand while swimming at the same location. He needed stitches but was expected to recover. 
North Carolina experienced an increase in shark attacks in 2015 with a record-breaking eight bites for the state over the course of the year. Florida experienced 30 attacks in 2015, contributing to the 98 shark attacks worldwide last year, the highest number of all-time according to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF). Of those attacks, 59 occurred in the United States. 
There have already been numerous shark encounters this year, including attacks on an 11-year-old girl and 57-year-old woman in Florida in May. CNN reports two shark attacks resulted in fatalities in June.

Shark expert Larry Cahoon tells PEOPLE that despite the onset of recent attacks, beachgoers shouldn&apos;t avoid the ocean. 
&quot;You have a higher chance of getting into a car accident driving to the beach than you do getting attacked by a shark when you get there,&quot; the professor of biology and marine biology at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, tells PEOPLE. &quot;The fact is that sharks have millions of contact hours with humans on beaches every year, yet attacks are really rare. Just be smart.&quot;</string>

		<string>Sterling, Asian stocks struggle with Brexit hangover</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>By Hideyuki Sano and Nichola Saminather

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell and the British pound tumbled more than 2 percent on Monday as markets struggled to shake off deep uncertainty sparked by Britain&apos;s decision to leave the European Union.

Sentiment remained weak even though the worst of the turmoil seen on Friday, when global stock markets suffered their biggest decline in nearly five years, had eased.

&quot;Things are so uncertain that investors still do not have a clear idea how much risk assets they need to sell,&quot; said Hiroko Iwaki, senior foreign bond strategist at Mizuho Securities.

&quot;But it is safe to assume investors are not yet done with all the selling they need to. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see another 10 percent fall in share prices,&quot; she added.

Among many questions the British exit, or Brexit, has triggered are just how much UK and European economies will slow, how they will negotiate their new relationship and how European leaders will try to boost the crumbling European Union.

U.S. S&amp;P mini futures, the world&apos;s most traded stock futures, fell 0.4 percent to 2,011.50, hovering close to Friday&apos;s 3-1/2 month low of 1,999.

MSCI&apos;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shrank losses to 0.6 percent as companies with UK exposure in particular came under more pressure.

Financials led declines in Australia and Hong Kong with the sector seen the among worst hit by Brexit and the prospect of London losing its prized &quot;EU passport&quot;.

&quot;We think Brexit could just be the first surprise in a re-calibration of the world away from globalization towards more inward looking policymaking,&quot; Ajay Singh Kapur, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.

&quot;Brexit has now possibly opened up more uncertainty about the European Union project, and that the already beated down Asian and emerging markets equity markets could receive asset allocation flows from Europe,&quot; he added.

Japan&apos;s Nikkei extended gains to 1.9 percent, a partial rebound after Friday&apos;s hefty 7.9 percent fall. Japanese stocks were helped by stronger warnings from Japanese officials that they may intervene in currency markets to stabilise the yen.

Still, the dollar fell 0.3 percent against the safe-haven yen, trading around 101.81 yen.

Chinese shares also gained, with the CSI 300 index and the Shanghai Composite both up about 0.8 percent.

The British pound fell 2 percent to $1.34, still some distance from the 31-year low of $1.3228 touched during Friday&apos;s wild trade.

The euro also came under further pressure, falling 0.8 percent against the dollar, as investors fret Brexit could stoke the anti-establishment mood in Europe and even talk of disintegration of the union.

&quot;(There will be) sell-off in the euro as talk of other exit referenda builds,&quot; said Jerome Booth, chairman of New Sparta Asset Management in London.

&quot;This sell-off will be more profound and long-lasting and will be not just against the dollar and yen but also against the pound. It will also raise fears of significant loss of values for holders of Euro-zone government bonds.&quot;

The euro fell to $1.1028, edging closer to Friday&apos;s 3-1/2-month low of $1.0912.

The euro&apos;s weakness helped to push the Chinese yuan to its weakest level against the dollar since December 2010 on Monday. It fell to 6.6396 per dollar after opening at 6.6360 per dollar, compared with the 5 1/2-year low midpoint level of 6.6375 set by the central bank, and touching an intraday low of 6.6469.

But in a sign Britain&apos;s shock decision to leave the European Union may be encouraging Europeans to seek the safety of the status quo, support for Spain&apos;s conservative People&apos;s Party (PP) surged in Sunday&apos;s general election.

Oil prices fell more than 1 percent in early trade, with international benchmark Brent futures down 0.3 percent to $48.28 per barrel.

U.S. crude slipped 0.5 percent to $47.40.

Demand for safe haven assets such as government debt and precious metals remained strong.

The 10-year U.S. debt yield dropped to 1.5020 percent. On Friday, it fell as low as 1.406 percent, near its record low of 1.381 percent marked in July 2012.

U.S. interest rate futures have completely priced out any chance of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year and are pricing in less than 50 percent chance of a rate hike even by the end of 2017.

Gold rose 0.6 percent to $1,323.68 per ounce.

		<string>Tour Confidential: Fallout from USGA disaster at Oakmont, More</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>(c) 2016 Time Inc. Tour Confidential: Billy Hurley III Win is Great for Golf Was Billy Hurley III winning the Quicken Loans National the best story of the year so far? Our panel debates. Every Sunday night, GOLF.com conducts an e-mail roundtable with writers from Sports Illustrated and Golf Magazine. Check in every week for the unfiltered opinions of our writers and editors and join the conversation in the comments section below.

1.) A day after the bizarre conclusion of the U.S. Open, USGA executive director Mike Davis admitted that his organization &quot;made a big bogey&quot; by waiting until after the fourth round to ding Dustin Johnson with a one-stroke penalty for causing his ball to move on the 5th green; Davis, it should be noted, made no apologies for the ruling itself. How would you assess how the USGA has responded to the considerable fallout from one of the most hotly debated rules controversies in major championship history?

Alan Shipnuck, senior writer, Sports Illustrated (@AlanShipnuck): It was a brutal public relations hit for the USGA, and Davis’s quasi-apology didn’t really help. I got the first interview with him at Oakmont. Davis was upstairs in the locker room changing into his tie for the trophy presentation and I pounced on him. At that point DJ was on the 16th hole and Davis still hadn’t seen video of the incident! He was just going by reports from other staffers. It was clearly an institutional breakdown in communication and procedures. This will all lead to some soul-searching and clearly the USGA needs to overhaul how it handles things on the ground at big tournaments.

Michael Bamberger, senior writer, Sports Illustrated: The USGA bungled how to share the information. This turned into a public-relations fiasco, but at its heart it was a gray rules question: did Dustin Johnson cause that ball to move or not? It doesn’t matter that the movement was so minimal. To protect ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS -- which is a fundamental role of a rules official -- Johnson had to be asked if he would feel differently about his answer to that question after seeing video of it. THE MORE INFORMATION THE BETTER because the goal is turn in THE MOST ACCURATE SCORE POSSIBLE. Likely a better approach would have been to say to Johnson on the sixth tee, When you come in from your round, let’s have you review the tape, as we feel it shows you were responsible for the ball’s movement. But give the player the first crack at it. In my opinion, the videotape was completely inconclusive and I would have not accessed Johnson the shot, but to reach another conclusion is entirely reasonable. Now if you want to say there should be a new rule by which these minute movements shouldn’t matter, go ahead and try to draft such a rule. But right now, the rule is that any movement must be accounted for and the USGA was trying to do right by Johnson and the rest of the field. That is its obligation. The rest -- including Tiger and Jordan and Big Jack himself -- is noise. The USGA is not in the public-relations business. Its purpose is to stage a championship and assure that the rules, which it tries constantly to improve, are applied fairly to all. 

Mark Godich, senior editor, Sports Illustrated (@MarkGodich): For Davis to respond any other way would have been another public-relations nightmare. Admit your mistake and move on. We’ll find out soon enough if the USGA learned anything from this. 

Josh Sens, contributing writer, GOLF Magazine (@JoshSens): As Mark says exactly: It’s the golden rule of damage control in pretty much all aspects of sports, business and life. Acknowledge error. Apologize. Onwards and upwards. Unfortunately, the incident and its handling only underscores the sense that many people have of golf being out of step with the rest of the world.

Joe Passov, senior editor, Golf Magazine (@joepassov): I’m reminded here of the legal maxim, &quot;Hard cases make bad law.” The whole thing was such a mess because there really weren’t established procedures in place for adjudication purposes. Right or wrong, it needed to be settled on that hole at that time. Credit Mike Davis, a really good guy, for stepping up and acknowledging the wrongdoing on the USGA’s part, but it doesn’t restore any faith in the system, because unless there are some changes effected, what’s to stop this from happening again?

Gary Van Sickle, senior writer, Sports Illustrated (@GaryVanSickle): Unbelievable is the only word. Nice of Davis to apologize for delay in penalty assessment, a terrible mistake. But by Monday, he had plenty of time to recognize that Hall and Pagel had wrongly assessed a penalty and ignored USGA’s own definition that “unless the facts show that a player caused the ball to move,” there is no penalty. I lost a lot of respect for the USGA on this one. This can’t happen again.

2.) After the episode at Oakmont, Chris Kirk tweeted, “There has always been a large contingent of @PGATOUR players that would like to separate from the @USGA and make our own rules to play by. It will be interesting to see if this fiasco makes that option a legitimate possibility.” Could this actually happen?

Shipnuck: Gawd, I hope not! Players are inherently selfish; they care only about what will help them. The USGA, for all of its flaws, serves the game. The people there make mistakes but their heart is in the right place. Letting the inmates run the asylum is not the answer.

Bamberger: Exactly. I love how the players had the bureaucrats and the architects and anybody trying to show them up. It’s part of the balance of power that makes the game great. 

Godich: I laughed. Exactly what good could come of this? 

Sens: Well, we’d at least have an opportunity to coin a term for the break-away. Would Gexit work? 

Shipnuck: Tour exits = Texits. Which sounds like Texas. Isn’t that already an independent nation-state? 

Godich: We’re working on it, Alan. 

Passov: Alan, I’m with you on this -- on the USGA. Not so much on Texas.

Van Sickle: It’s not going to happen due to a mess of conflicting interests. That said, I’ve heard worse ideas.

SCORES: Check Out the Final Leaderboard from Quicken Loans National

3.) Billy Hurley III, a 34-year-old former Navy lieutenant, won the Quicken Loans Invitational at Congressional on Sunday to claim his first PGA Tour title. The win came after a trying year for Hurley, whose father, Willard, took his own life last July. Where does Hurley&apos;s victory rank on the list of best stories of 2016?

Shipnuck: Right near the top. To go from the Naval Academy to Kapalua is a pretty incredible journey. To have to overcome a crushing family tragedy that played out in public makes Hurley’s perseverance all the more remarkable. Much respect for him as a player and person. 

Godich: I didn’t think anyone could have topped Jim Herman’s out-of-nowhere victory in Houston, but Hurley just did. The 607th-ranked player in the world, a former Navy lieutenant still coping with the tragic death of his father, wins at Congressional, down the road from Annapolis as well as his hometown. You can’t make this stuff up.

Bamberger: Jim Herman 1, Bill Hurley 1A. Or the other way around. 

Sens: I profiled Hurley some years ago around the time of his pro debut. A modest, self-sacrificing guy who was easy to root for then and all the more so now after all he’s been through. Great story without a doubt. As for the biggest story, I don’t think we can top DJ breaking through at a major, but it doesn’t have quite the same heartstring pluck as Hurley&apos;s.

Passov: Michael, I’m on your side, as far as “best” story of 2016 goes. However, I’m going to elevate Billy Hurley. Jim Herman’s story was remarkable in that it was the ultimate tale of perseverance, a grinder/journeyman finally made good. For Billy Hurley, making the five-year sacrifice for his country is so unusual that you rooted for him every time he teed it up. To see him overcome the tabloid-ready aspects of his father’s suicide, to emerge from the doldrums of competing in golf’s minor leagues and to do it as basically a hometown win. This is the best story so far in 2016.</string>

		<string>A lot of people are having trouble with this math problem that requires some basic algebra Nothing like a viral mind boggling math problem to make you feel like you should have paid better attention in high school algebra.

The equation in question? 9 – 3 ÷ 1/3 + 1 = ? The deceptively simply math problem recently blew up in Japan, as people quickly found they were routinely getting the wrong answer. According to PopSugar, only 60 percent of 20-somethings solve it correctly, a study showed.

So what is the remaining 40 percent doing right? YouTube user MindYourDecisions shows you, bringing in mathematician Presh Talwalkar, the man behind the problem, to explain how it’s done.

The trick is to remember PEMDAS, the order of operations formula, which stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. As Talwalkar explains, this means first tackling 3 ÷ 1/3. Three divided by 1/3 is nine, and then carrying along with the equation from left to right you end up with the correct answer of — drum role, please: 1!

Unfortunately, it’s been a while for many of us (or it hasn’t but we just didn’t pay that much attention in algebra) and most people who get it wrong actually fall down on entering the fraction into a calculator. Other people who get it wrong forget about PEMDAS, and simply do the equation from left to right. Common incorrect answers end up being 3, 7, or 9.

Of course, it’s just a silly math problem — or is it? According to the video, the 60% rate of correct answers is down from 90% in the 1980s. What could this big drop in accuracy suggest? Is it possible that our dependence on easy internet research and calculators means we’re committing fewer algebra principles, like PEMDAS, to memory? It’s a fascinating question, and we’re going to go look up the quadratic equation real quick, just in case.

		<string>50 Cent Heads Home After Caribbean Cursing Arrest</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>50 Cent was arrested at the St. Kitts Music Festival. (Photo: Getty Images)

50 Cent’s trip to St. Kitts wasn’t your typical celebrity getaway. The “In da Club” rapper found himself in da courthouse after getting arrested for using “indecent language,” which is prohibited by law, during a performance on Saturday night.

The 40-year-old performer (real name: Curtis Jackson) headlined the St. Kitts Music Festival. While performing “P.I.M.P.,” 50 — who had been warned not to use profanity, according to TMZ — sang the word “motherf*****” several times in front of 40,000 concertgoers. He was formally arrested and charged for the offense of “making use of indecent language” during his performance, according to the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force.

While the Power star initially had to “surrender his travel documents” ahead of a court appearance on Monday, according to police, his rep tells Yahoo that the issue is already resolved — and he’s headed back to the U.S.

“Mr. Jackson was only booked to host the show,” explained his spokeswoman, Amanda Ruisi. “When he arrived at the festival, organizers asked him to perform, he obliged, and used the DJ they had there. Unfortunately, they didn’t have the clean version to his tracks, so there were profanities used during his performance. The show was a great success, and he will make sure for future trips to St. Kitts that he leaves the ‘motherf*****s’ in the United States.”

She added, “He went to court today and paid a fine and is on his way home.”

50 Cent, who has had several serious run-ins with the law in his life, isn’t the first performer to be arrested for using bad words on the island. In 2003, DMX was arrested for using profanity at the same music fest.</string>

		<string>Niger Delta Avengers urge Nigeria&apos;s Buhari to visit southern oil hub</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - The Niger Delta Avengers, a Nigerian militant group which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on oil facilities in the country&apos;s southern energy hub, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to visit the region.

The militant group says it wants a greater share of Nigeria&apos;s oil wealth to go to the impoverished Delta region. Crude sales make up about 70 percent of Nigeria&apos;s national income and most of that oil comes from the southern swampland.

Last week, Petroleum Ministry officials said the government had agreed a one-month ceasefire with the militants, but the group later denied that.

&quot;President Buhari should visit Niger Delta,&quot; the Avengers said on their Twitter feed on Saturday.

Last month Buhari, a 73-year-old former military ruler, cancelled a trip to the region at the last minute, days before flying to London to receive treatment for an ear infection. It would have been his first visit to the area since taking office in May 2015.

&quot;Mr. President come and see for yourself what the host communities are going through in the hands of Nigeria government and the multinationals,&quot; the group said in a message on its website, adding that he should go to various export terminals.

On Twitter the group, which has previously called for the Niger Delta to break away, also urged Buhari to hold a referendum &quot;just like what David Cameron of Great Britain did&quot; to enable people to &quot;decide if they want to stay as Nigerians&quot;.

Nigeria, an OPEC member, was Africa&apos;s top oil producer until the spate of attacks in the last few months pushed it behind Angola. Production has fallen from 2.2 million barrels at the start of the year to around 1.6 million barrels.

		<string>Hillary Clinton’s State Dept. Calendar Missing Scores of Entries</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string>(WASHINGTON) — An Associated Press review of the official calendar Hillary Clinton kept as secretary of state identified at least 75 meetings with longtime political donors, Clinton Foundation contributors and corporate and other outside interests that were not recorded or omitted the names of those she met.

The fuller details of those meetings were included in files the State Department turned over to the AP after it sued the government in federal court.

The missing entries raise new questions about how Clinton and her inner circle handled government records documenting her State Department tenure — in this case, why the official chronology of her four-year term does not closely mirror the other, more detailed records of her daily meetings.

At a time when Clinton’s private email system is under scrutiny by an FBI criminal investigation, the calendaromissions reinforce concerns that she sought to eliminate the “risk of the personal being accessible” — as she wrote in an email exchange that she failed to turn over to the government but was subsequently uncovered in a top aide’s inbox.

The AP found the omissions by comparing the 1,500-page calendar with separate planning schedules supplied toClinton by aides in advance of each day’s events. The names of at least 114 outsiders who met with Clinton were missing from her calendar, the records show.

No known federal laws were violated and some omissions could be blamed on Clinton’s highly fluid schedule, which sometimes forced late cancellations. But only seven meetings in Clinton’s planning schedules were replaced by substitute events on her official calendar. More than 60 other events listed in Clinton’s planners were omitted entirely in her calendar, tersely noted or described only as “private meetings” — all without naming those who met with her.

Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said Thursday night that the multiple discrepancies between her State Department calendar and her planning schedules “simply reflect a more detailed version in one version as compared to another, all maintained by her staff.”

Merrill said that Clinton “has always made an effort to be transparent since entering public life, whether it be the release of over 30 years of tax returns, years of financial disclosure forms, or asking that 55,000 pages of work emails from her time of secretary of state be turned over to the public.”

In one key omission, Clinton’s State Department calendar dropped the identities of a dozen major Wall Street and business leaders who met with her during a private breakfast discussion at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2009, The meeting occurred minutes before Clinton appeared in public at the exchange to ring the market’s ceremonial opening bell.

Despite the omission, Clinton’s State Department planning schedules from the same day listed the names of allClinton’s breakfast guests — most of whose firms had lobbied the government and donated to her family’s global charity. The event was closed to the press and merited only a brief mention in her calendar, which omitted all her guests’ names — among them Blackstone Group Chairman Steven Schwarzman, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and then-New York Bank of Mellon CEO Robert Kelly.

Clinton’s calendar also repeatedly omitted private dinners and meetings with political donors, policy sessions with groups of corporate leaders and “drop-bys” with old Clinton campaign hands and advisers. Among those whose names were omitted from her calendar were longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal, consultant and former ClintonWhite House chief of staff Thomas “Mack” McLarty, former energy lobbyist Joseph Wilson and entertainment magnate and Clinton campaign bundler Haim Saban.

The AP first sought Clinton’s calendar and schedules from the State Department in August 2013, but the agency would not acknowledge even that it had the material. After nearly two years of delay, the AP sued the State Department in March 2015. The department agreed in a court filing last August to turn over Clinton’s calendar, and provided the documents in November. After noticing discrepancies between Clinton’s calendar and some schedules, the AP pressed in court for all of Clinton’s planning material. The U.S. has released about one-third of those planners to the AP, so far.

The State Department censored both sets of documents for national security and other reasons, but those changes were made after the documents were turned over to the State Department at the end of Clinton’stenure.

The documents obtained by the AP do not show who specifically logged entries in Clinton’s calendar or who edited the material. Clinton’s emails and other records show that she and two close aides, deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin and scheduling assistant Lona J. Valmoro, held weekly meetings and emailed almost every day aboutClinton’s plans. According to the recent inspector general’s audit and a court declaration made last December by the State Department’s acting executive secretary, Clinton’s aides had access to her calendar through a government Microsoft Outlook account. Both Abedin and Valmoro were political appointees at the State Department and are now aides in her presidential campaign.

Unlike Clinton’s planning schedules, which were sent to Clinton each morning, her calendar was edited after each event, the AP’s review showed. Some calendar entries were accompanied by Valmoro emails — indicating she may have added those entries. Every meeting entry also included both the planned time of the event and the actual time — showing that Clinton’s calendar was being used to document each meeting after it ended.

The State Department said Friday that “extensive records” from Clinton’s calendars were preserved. Spokesman John Kirby said he couldn’t speak in more detail about practices during Clinton’s tenure because of the AP’s ongoing lawsuit.

Kirby said the department was confident it was properly preserving Secretary John Kerry’s calendars and other historic documents, but he noted that Kerry was not required to include details of private, non-work-related meetings. Kirby declined to specify the agency’s definition of those private sessions, saying only that “there are obviously some moments of his life that have no bearing on his work as secretary of state.”

Kirby would not comment on how Clinton and other former secretaries handled their calendars. Five former State Department logistics officials told the AP that some of Clinton’s predecessors also omitted some private meetings from their calendars. The former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss sensitive agency practices, said omitted meetings typically were for medical or other personal reasons as opposed to the meetings Clinton attended with political and charity donors and with corporate executives.

P.J. Crowley, a State Department spokesman for Clinton at the time, told the AP that Clinton’s vision of “21st century statecraft” included exchanging views with corporate leaders and promoting public-private partnerships. “That was certainly reflected in her day-to-day schedule, her travel and her global outreach,” Crowley said.

The former department officials as well as government records experts said that secretaries of state have wide latitude in keeping their schedules — despite federal laws and agency rules overseeing the archiving of calendarsand warning against altering or deleting records. Omissions in Clinton’s calendar could undermine the document’s historical accuracy, particularly its depictions of Clinton’s access to political, corporate and other influences, experts said.

“It’s clear that any outside influence needs to be clearly identified in some way to at least guarantee transparency. That didn’t happen,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government reform group. “These discrepancies are striking because of her possible interest at the time in running for the presidency.”

Clinton’s terse calendar entry on her 2009 private breakfast on Wall Street contains no details on what she and her 12 guests discussed.

Besides Schwarzman, Nooyi and Kelly, Clinton’s other guests were Fabrizio Freda, CEO of the Estee Lauder Companies Inc.; Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks Corp.; Lewis Frankfort, chairman of Coach Inc.; Ellen Kullman, then-CEO of DuPont; David M. Cote, CEO of Honeywell International Inc.; James Tisch, president of Loews Corp.; John D. Wren, CEO of Omnicom Group; then-McGraw Hill Companies chairman Harold McGraw III; and James Taiclet, chairman of the American Tower Corp. Also attending was then-NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer, who later accompanied Clinton when she rang the stock exchange bell.

Four of the attendees — Schwarzman, Nooyi, Cote and Kullman — headed companies that later donated to Clinton’s pet diplomatic project of that period, the U.S. pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo.

All the firms represented except Coach lobbied the government in 2009; Blackstone, Honeywell, Omnicom and DuPont lobbied the State Department that year. Schwarzman and Frankfort have personally donated to theClinton Foundation, and the other firms — except for American Tower and New York Bank of Mellon — also contributed to the Clinton charity.
